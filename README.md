Productivity guru Max Deutsch outlines [here](https://medium.com/@maxdeutsch/how-i-mastered-the-saturday-nyt-crossword-puzzle-in-31-days-fe6a094edccd) his technique for quickly mastering crossword. By aggregating the data from thousands of New York Times crosswords as plain text, he quickly studied reams clues and solutions.

Presented here is a program that downloads crossword clues and solutions from The Guardian's web-hosted cryptic crosswords and writes them to a local .CSV file.

## Usage
To run
`node index.js`


##Â Options
`--output` - the output CSV file. 
`--connections` - the number of concurrent downloads. 2 by default
`--first` - the id of the first crossword to download
`--last` - the id of the last crossword to download

Note that the id seems to refer to days since their first crossword. As such, there are id gaps on days when no crossword was published.
